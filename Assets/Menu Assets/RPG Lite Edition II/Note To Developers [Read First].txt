Greetings, fellow creatives!

Thank-you heartily for purchasing this music pack. Over the course of several months, my brother (Adam) and I have poured our hearts
into creating customizable and memorable music specifically for RPG games. We are overjoyed that you decided to purchase our pack!

I hope you consider leaving a review at https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/43545

-------

Within this music pack, we have created 5 RPG tunes with Fade Outs, Loops, and Short Loops Folders:

	() The Fade Outs Folder: Used to play one-shot tracks that are only used once. 

	() The Loops Folder: Used to loop music indefinitely. This is the most common use of this music pack.

	() The Short Loops Folder: Used to loop certain sections of each song. You can also mix together different short loops for 
		interesting results.

-------

All audio assets are rendered in WAV at 44.1 Khz and 16Bit.
